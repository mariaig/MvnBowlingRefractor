===================
Bowling is a sport in which a player rolls a bowling ball with the objective of scoring points by knocking down as many pins as possible. <br><br>
The bowler is allowed 10 frames in which to knock down pins, with frames one (1) through nine (9) being composed of up to two rolls. The tenth frame may be composed of up to three rolls (in case of a bonus roll).<br><br><br>
There are 3 types of throws in bowling:<br>
->	Strike –you knock down all pins in the first roll<br>
->	Spare - you knock down all pins using the second roll<br>
->	Open – one or more missed pinns still standing after the second ball<br>
<br>
Now about how you keep the score:<br>
->	When you have a strike, the partial score is calculated as the sum between this roll and the next two rolls (also, at this frame, you will not have a second roll)<br>
->	When you have a spare, the partial score is calculated as the sum between the current frame and the next roll<br>
-> When you have an open, the partial score is calculated as the sum of the knoked down pins<br>
When you’ll be at the 10-th frame there are several exceptions for calculating the score:<br>
->	If you have a strike, then you are allowed to have 2 more rolls<br>
->	If you have a spare, then you are allowed to have 1 more roll<br>
->	If you have an open you get nothing more<br>
<br>
In the end, a perfect game is the one in which you had 12 strikes => total score :300<br>
